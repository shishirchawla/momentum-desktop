# momentum-desktop
Application to get latest momentum wallpapers, and set them as the desktop background.

So I found a couple of solutions to do this but they all used the chrome plugin's local storage to fetch the daily wallpaper. I don't use Chrome as my daily web browser, so I decided to make this project that can run completely independent of Chrome. All you need to have is a Momentum account to use this service, there is no need to have chrome or the plugin installed, although having them won't hurt.
